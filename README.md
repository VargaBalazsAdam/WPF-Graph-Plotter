# Graph Plotter

The Graph Plotter is a simple Windows desktop application that allows users to plot mathematical functions and visualize them on a canvas. It supports a wide range of mathematical expressions and provides zooming capabilities for a detailed view.

## Features

- Plot mathematical functions easily.
- Zoom in and out to explore functions at various scales.
- Supports a wide range of mathematical functions, including trigonometric and exponential functions.
- Grid lines for better visualization.
- Error handling for invalid expressions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Windows operating system.
- .NET Framework installed.

### Installation

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Open the solution in Visual Studio.

3. Build the solution.

4. Run the application.

## Usage

1. Enter a mathematical function in the input box.

2. Click the "Plot" button to visualize the function.

3. Use the "Zoom In" and "Zoom Out" buttons to adjust the scale.

4. Observe the plotted function on the canvas.

## Supported Functions

The application supports a wide range of mathematical functions, including but not limited to:

- Basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /).
- Exponents (^).
- Trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan, ctg).
- Exponential functions (exp, log).
- Square roots (sqrt).
- Constants (e, pi).

## Examples

You can enter expressions like:

- `x^2 + 2*x - 1`
- `sin(x) * cos(x^2) + tan(x/2) - 0.5 * x^3`
- `sqrt(x) * e^x`
